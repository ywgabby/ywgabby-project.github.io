<h1>Data import and cleaning</h1>
<p>In the process of preparing our data for analysis, we have
established a set of inclusion and variable selection criteria to ensure
the relevance of our study. These criteria are vital to the successful
execution of our data science investigation.</p>
<p>One of the primary inclusion criteria for our analysis is the
exclusion of free games from our dataset. This decision is underpinned
by the understanding that in free-to-play games, in-app purchases often
serve as viable alternatives to traditional game sales. However, due to
the unavailability of comprehensive data pertaining to these in-app
purchases, their inclusion in our analysis would be both impractical and
imprecise.</p>
<p>In addition, we have also opted to remove certain variables from our
dataset that are non-essential for our analysis.</p>
<p>We eliminate columns containing URLs as they do not contribute
meaningful information to our analytical objectives.</p>
<p>Variables associated with game developers and publishers will be
filtered out for two primary reasons. Firstly, we posit that making
predictions or quantify the effect of developer names may be
challenging, if not unfeasible. Secondly, we hypothesize that brand
effects can be more accurately captured through a combination of game
features and keywords, for example, there is a tag for independent
games, which is the complement of games made by large companies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will exclude the variables “Playtime in Current Two
Weeks” as it may not be representative for older games, and “Average
Playtime Forever” in favor of “Median Playtime Forever” due to potential
distortions caused by AFK (Away From Keyboard) gamers.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that we are cognizant of the need to address
potential data leakage issues and redundant feature when fitting our
model. These aspects will be thoroughly addressed in subsequent stages
of our analysis to ensure the robustness of our findings.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df = read.csv(&quot;DATA/games.csv&quot;)|&gt;

<h2>definition of popular games</h2>
<p>In our project, the exploration of key features of popular games
forms a central objective. To establish a precise definition of “popular
games” in the context of our analysis, we will primarily adhere to the
standard set by Steam, a prominent gaming platform[<a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/ivz45n/what_does_the_steam_ratings_like_very_negative_or/"
class="uri">https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/ivz45n/what_does_the_steam_ratings_like_very_negative_or/</a>]
According to Steam’s rating system, we will categorize games as
“popular” if they fall into the following rating categories: mostly
positive, positive, very positive, overwhelmingly positive. This
approach ensures that we consider user sentiment as a crucial aspect of
popularity.</p>
<p>However, we recognize that popularity encompasses more than just
ratings; it also pertains to the volume of users who purchase and engage
with a game. To account for this broader perspective of popularity, we
have incorporated the following criteria:</p>
<p>Estimated Owners: We will exclude games with an estimated owner count
in the range of 0-0 and 0-20,000. This criteria ensures that we focus on
games with a substantial user base.</p>
<p>Median Playtime: Games selected for analysis will have a median
playtime exceeding 120 minutes. This threshold corresponds to the latest
time frame within which Steam allows game refunds. This criterion
further refines our definition of popular games by considering active
engagement and retention, which are indicative of a game’s enduring
appeal.</p>
<p>By combining these rating, ownership, and playtime criteria, we aim
to create a comprehensive definition of “popular games” that accounts
for both user sentiment and the size of the player base, enabling us to
explore key features that contribute to a game’s popularity in a
holistic manner.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_popular = df|&gt;

<p>Based on tables, it is evident that popular games consistently
exhibit higher prices when compared to their less popular counterparts
across all quadrants. This trend can be logically attributed to several
key factors that play a pivotal role in shaping the pricing dynamics
within the gaming industry. Game</p>
<p>Mechanics: Popular games often incorporate complex and engaging game
mechanics that elevate the overall gaming experience. The development
and refinement of such intricate mechanics requires investment in terms
of design, testing, and optimization, all of which contribute to higher
production costs and reflect on the final price.</p>
<p>Animation Effects: The visually captivating animation effects is a
hallmark of popular games. These effects enhance immersion and player
engagement, but their creation requires the expertise of skilled artists
and animators, thereby increasing development expenses.</p>
<p>Game Optimization: Popular games prioritize performance optimization
to ensure smooth gameplay across a wide range of hardware
configurations(although some popular games still have tons of bugs).
Achieving such optimization demands rigorous coding and testing efforts,
which in turn incur additional costs.</p>
<p>Also, we used statistical test to test whether there is difference in
the two price distribution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_unpopular = df_unpopular|&gt;subset(name != &quot;Ascent Free-Roaming VR Experience&quot;)

combined_data = rbind(data.frame(dataset = &quot;unpopular&quot;, price = log(df_unpopular$price)),
                       data.frame(dataset = &quot;popular&quot;, price = log(df_popular$price)))

ggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = price, fill = dataset)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.75)+
  facet_grid(~dataset)</code></pre>
<p><img src="about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The two distribution loos approximately normal, so we decide to use
T-test to test whether two groups’s log transformed price have similar
distribution.</p>
<p>H0: they have same mean price H1: they have different mean price</p>
<pre class="r"><code>result &lt;- t.test(log(df_popular$price), log(df_unpopular$price))
result</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

## 
## data:  log(df_popular$price) and log(df_unpopular$price)
## t = 52.203, df = 6600.4, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0

## sample estimates:

##  2.346463  1.615510</code></pre>
<p>The result shows a p-value smaller than 0.05, so we reject the null
and conclude that the two groups have different mean price.</p>

<h2>price distribution of games with different estimated owners</h2>

<p>From the price distribution plot of games categorized by different
estimated owner counts, a notable pattern emerges. Specifically, games
with a greater number of estimated owners tend to exhibit relatively
higher prices. However, an intriguing observation is that once a certain
threshold of estimated owners is reached, the prices of games begin to
decline. ### Overall frequency of keywords(genre, categories, tags)</p>
<p>Here, we try to explore the trend of keywords in genre, categories,
tags.</p>

  coord_flip()

<p><img src="about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the bar plot, it is evident that single-player games have
highest frequency in our dataset, this is reasonable since multi-player
games require higher optimization, single player games is the best
choice for independent game maker. The VR related categories have low
frequency in games, this is because the equipment is expensive and the
technology is relatively new.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>genre_freq = df|&gt;
  separate_rows(genres, sep = &quot;,&quot;)|&gt;
  group_by(genres)|&gt;

<p>As there are too many tags in steam, we only show most frequent tags,
interestingly, we found there are more puzzle games compared to RPG,
this might because the development cost of puzzle games are lower than
RPG.</p>

<h2>Trend of keywords frequency across different years</h2>
<p>It might be informative to visualize the trend change of game genre
developed in different years since WOW might be good game at 2000s,
while games like Overwatch might be better game in 2020s.</p>

</table>
<p>We could see from the table that there are very few games on steam
before 2006, genre frequency might be strongly affected by randomness in
those years, so we choose only to plot the trend after 2005.</p>

<p><img src="about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We found some interesting trend from the line plot:</p>
<p>Rise of Indie Games: A prominent observation is the surge in the
frequency of the “Indie” genre, particularly after 2012. This phenomenon
is likely attributable to the increase in the number of computers per
person. These developments have made it easier for independent game
developers to create and publish their games.</p>
<p>Shift in Genre Popularity: The line plot also highlights a noteworthy
trend in the Action genre. While it remains dominant, it has experienced
a gradual decline in frequency over the years. This shift may be
influenced by changing player preferences and the emergence of diverse
gaming experiences in other genres. It suggests that players are
increasingly seeking a wider variety of gaming experiences beyond
traditional action games.</p>
<p>Casual Games on the Rise: The period from 2012 to 2023 shows an
increase in the frequency of “Casual” games. This may be indicative of a
growing market for games that offer accessible and relaxed gameplay
experiences. This might also indecate people are craving for relaxation
instead of stimulation.</p>
<p>Early Access Strategy: The “Early Access” games on Steam experienced
a notable increase in their frequency. This approach provides
independent game developers with the opportunity to release their games
in a partially completed state, allowing them to gather player feedback,
iterate on their games, and secure investment more easily. The
popularity of this strategy underscores its effectiveness in the
independent game development ecosystem.</p>

<p>The distinctions revealed among the three word clouds are insightful
and provide valuable context for understanding the characteristics that
differentiate popular and unpopular games:</p>
<p>Prevalence of Adventure Games in Unpopular Games: Adventure games
appear to be more prevalent among unpopular games and are less common in
popular games. This discrepancy may stem from the accessibility of game
development tools like RPG Maker, which enables the creation of
adventure games with relative ease. Consequently, the market may be
flooded with a range of adventure games of varying quality, leading to
their uneven representation among unpopular titles.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Difficulty in Popular Games: The word cloud for popular
games prominently features the tag “difficult.” This aligns with the
reality that some of the most highly regarded games in the industry,
such as Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, are renowned for their
challenging gameplay. The presence of this tag underscores the appeal of
a high level of difficulty in certain popular titles.</p>
<p>Ratio of 2D to 3D Games: Notably, the word cloud suggests that the
ratio of 2D games to 3D games is higher in popular games compared to
unpopular ones. This observation may be attributed to resource
constraints faced by smaller game development studios. In many cases,
these studios may prioritize the development of engaging plotlines and
intricate game mechanics over the creation of elaborate 3D environments,
resulting in a higher prevalence of 2D games among popular titles.</p>
<p>Popularity of Pixel Graphics: The higher frequency of the “pixel
graphics” tag in popular games is an intriguing finding. Pixel graphics
are favored by independent developers as they allow a strong focus on
game mechanics. This aligns with the success stories of games like
Terraria and Minecraft, which have leveraged pixel graphics to create
immersive and engaging gameplay experiences. The appeal of pixel
graphics in popular games reflects the importance of gameplay and
mechanics in driving their popularity.</p>
